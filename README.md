# react-clicky-game

This is a React application created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app.

The application renders images of cartoon characters to the screen.  Each image listens for a click event.  
The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.  Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.  Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.
